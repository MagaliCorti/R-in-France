# ordering data sets according to a certain column of our data
# sort our data according to the variable x3
arrange(data, x3)


###### Example 2: filter Function

# creates a subset of our original data frame, in which only rows with the value 2 in the variable x2 are retained
filter(data, x2 == 2)


###### Example 3: mutate Function

rename(data, new_name = x3)


###### Example 6: sample_n Function 

# randomly samples N cases from our data frame
# sample three rows of our original data without replacement
# set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(765)
sample_n(data, 3)


###### Example 7: select Function

# Applied Statistics in R Part 1


############ applied statistics terms

# parametric -  assuming idea of normality in the distribution (student t-test, anova analysis of variance)
# vs
# non-parametric - non normal distribution, skewed distribution, more frequent

# independence - describe situa in which obs are not related to each other, on obs convey no info about the next
# independent variables - predictor variable or x-variables representing the experimental variable that is being manibulated in a manipulative study or observed across gradients to asses their effect
# dependent variable - response variable or y-variable

# binomial data -- data that can be class into two discrete categories

# homoscedasticity - homogeneity of variances

# replication - increase sample size, influence inferences (pseudoreplication when replication are not independent)

# nesting - some prdictor variables or observation of the response variable can be broken down into finer groups within groups (hyerarchy)

# mixed effect models - mixed models - used to account for non-independence among observation  by including random effects taht capture the relationship among observations and fixed effects that pertain to the hypotesis being tested
# generalized linear models - models  fit to data to that do not meet the assumption of normal distribution
# non normal distribution - binomial (two outcome only) vs Poisson (only non negative, mean and variance are equal) vs negative binomial vs zero inflated Poisson
# additive models - model in which we do not have a linear or curvy relationship, very dynamic relations
